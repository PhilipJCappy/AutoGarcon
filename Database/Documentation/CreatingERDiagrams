Google has a ER Diagram creater that allows the user to insert each relation, attribute, and entity.
The application is called diagrams and is used for creating all types of diagrams but has it's own subsection for ER diagrams.
The diagrams can be saved to google drive and can be accessed through draw.io.
MySQL also has a function that can create an ER diagram but it is more difficult to understand due to the way it is formatted.

When creating an ER Diagram, be sure that lines do not intersect each other as this makes it difficult to read.
For the center entity, use the entity that has the most relations, this will make it easier to format the diagram as a whole.
