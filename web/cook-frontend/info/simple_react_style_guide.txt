Many of the basic styling rules from Airbnb's style guide:
Style guide: https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/
Reference https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates for an example of how Airbnb implements their style guide


One component per file
- multiple stateless components are allowed in one file

Extend React.Component, don't use React.createClass

Components with no state should use normal functions, not classes or arrow functions

.jsx extension for react components

PascalCase for filenames

PascalCase for React components and camelCase for their instances
- import ReservationCard from './ReservationCard';
- const reservationItem = <ReservationCard />;

Use the filename as the component name

Root component of a directory should be index.jsx

Higher-order Component Naming <------- ?

Don't use DOM component prop names for different purposes
- Good: <MyComponent variant="fancy" />
- Bad: <MyComponent className="fancy" />

JSX:
Multiple props both go on separate line
- Good:
<Foo
  superLongParam="bar"
  anotherSuperLongParam="baz"
/>
- Good: <Foo bar="bar" />

Use double quotes for JSX attributes and single quotes for all other JS

Include a single space in your self-closing tag
- <Foo />

Don't pad JSX attributes with spaces
- Good: bar={baz}

Use camelCase for prop names

Avoid using array index as key prop
- Good: key={item.id}
- Bad: key={index}

Define explicit defaultProps for all non-required props
- Component.defaultProps = {bar: '', children: null};

Use ref callbacks
- Good: ref={(ref) => { this.myRef = ref; }
- Bad: ref="myRef"

Wrap JSX tags in parentheses when they span more than one line

Self-close tags that have no children

Bind event handlers for the render method in the constructor
- don't use inline function

Look at how to define propTypes, defaultProps, contextTypes. Search the document.
