SQL Text:
   use  test_schema;
create  table menu(
          item_id INT,
          restaurant_id VARCHAR(50),
          item_name VARCHAR(50),
          calorie_num INT,
          category VARCHAR(50)
          image BLOB,
          in_stock BOOLEAN,
          price FLOAT
        );

SELECT *
  FROM sample.main_menu_test2;

Summary: Used two different methods to create table. Used SQL statements to create a table initially and imported data from the CSV file.
This method allows for more customization and insurance that all the columns are correctly formatted before the data is inputted. Importing
a direct CSV file is easier but requires more modification to the table after it is completed.

Notes for next time: I would recommend creating the table with SQL and importing the data later. This allows for more customization and
better care.
