SQL Text:
DELETE
  FROM sample.main_menu_test2
 WHERE item_name like 'Item Name' AND restaurant like 'Restaurant' AND calorie_num=0 AND price=0 AND category like 'Category' AND in_stock like 'In Stock?';

Summary: Clean up for import. Updated schema. Have sample tables that can be downloaded and imported as CSV files.

Notes: Not too bad trying to fix some of the csv file issues. MySQL makes table management relatively easy.
