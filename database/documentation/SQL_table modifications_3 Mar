Date 3 March

SQL Text:
DELETE FROM sample.main_menu_test2
WHERE dish_name like 'Dish Name' AND restaurant like 'Restaurant' AND calories=0 AND price=0 AND tax=0 AND customer like 'Customer Inputs' AND category like 'Category'
AND breakfast like 'Breakfast' AND lunch like 'Lunch' AND dinner like 'Dinner' AND in_stock like 'In Stock?';

Summary: Had to clean up the directly imported csv file. Emma is workin to modify the csvs so they are easier to input and less manipulation
is needed once the data is inputted.

Notes: Not too bad trying to fix some of the csv file issues. MySQL makes table management relatively easy.
