SQL Text:
use test_schema;
create table main_menu(
dish_Name VARCHAR(50),
restaurant VARCHAR(50),
calories int,
price float,
tax float,
customer VARCHAR(50),
category VARCHAR(50),
breakfast VARCHAR(3),
lunch VARCHAR(3),
dinner VARCHAR(3),
picture VARCHAR(3),
in_stock BOOLEAN
);

SELECT *
FROM sample.main_menu_test2;

Summary: Used two different methods to create table. Used SQL statements to create a table initially and imported data from the CSV file.
This method allows for more customization and insurance that all the columns are correctly formatted before the data is inputted. Importing
a direct CSV file is easier but requires more modification to the table after it is completed.

Notes for next time: I would recommend creating the table with SQL and importing the data later. This allows for more customization and
better care.
