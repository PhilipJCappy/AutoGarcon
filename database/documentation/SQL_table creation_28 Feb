SQL Text:
use test_schema;
create table main_menu(
dish_Name VARCHAR(50),
restaurant VARCHAR(50),
calories int,
price float,
tax float,
customer VARCHAR(50),
category VARCHAR(50),
breakfast VARCHAR(3),
lunch VARCHAR(3),
dinner VARCHAR(3),
picture VARCHAR(3),
in_stock BOOLEAN
);

SELECT *
FROM sample.main_menu_test2;

Summary: Used two different methods to create table. Used SQL statements to create a table initially and imported data from the CSV file.
This method allows for more customization and insurance that all the columns are correctly formatted before the data is inputted. Importing
a direct CSV file is easier but requires more modification to the table after it is completed.

Notes for next time: I would recommend creating the table with SQL and importing the data later. This allows for more customization and
better care. 

Date 3 March

SQL Text:
DELETE FROM sample.main_menu_test2
WHERE dish_name like 'Dish Name' AND restaurant like 'Restaurant' AND calories=0 AND price=0 AND tax=0 AND customer like 'Customer Inputs' AND category like 'Category'
AND breakfast like 'Breakfast' AND lunch like 'Lunch' AND dinner like 'Dinner' AND in_stock like 'In Stock?';

Summary: Had to clean up the directly imported csv file. Emma is workin to modify the csvs so they are easier to input and less manipulation
is needed once the data is inputted.

Notes: Not too bad trying to fix some of the csv file issues. MySQL makes table management relatively easy.
